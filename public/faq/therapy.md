   We offer online individual counselling, couples therapy, child and adolescent counselling, and career guidance sessions. For trainees, we also provide supervised therapy sessions to help you gain practical, hands-on experience under expert mentorship.

2. Who will I be speaking with during my session?
   All sessions are led by qualified, trained, and experienced therapists from The Mind Point’s network. If you opt for a supervised session, you will work with a trainee counsellor under the close guidance of a senior therapist.

3. How do I book a session?

   A standard therapy session is 45–60 minutes long. Supervised sessions and special consultations may vary slightly in duration depending on the case and focus.
