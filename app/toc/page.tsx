            circumstances, including but not limited to personal conflicts,
            technical issues, dissatisfaction with faculty, mismatched
            expectations, or any other reasons. All schedules are fixed and
            non-negotiable from the point of registration. If you are unable to
            attend a scheduled batch due to any reason, you will forfeit your
            participation in that batch without refund or credit. Transfer to
            the next available batch may be permitted only under the following

              as medical emergencies supported by official medical bills,
              doctor's certificates, or other irrefutable evidence of inability
              to attend (e.g., hospitalization records). Proof must be submitted
              in writing within 48 hours of the issue arising, and approval is
              at the sole discretion of The Mind Point. No other circumstances,
              including work commitments, travel, or personal dissatisfaction,

            within a reasonable timeframe (as determined by The Mind Point), no

            timings, content, or other factors. Attendance constitutes full
            acceptance of the Service as delivered, and no disputes will be
            entertained thereafter. Repeated requests or complaints after
            partial attendance may result in immediate termination of access to

            sole discretion, and no reasons, explanations, complaints, or
            appeals regarding marks or evaluations will be entertained. Failure
            to comply may result in disqualification, failure of the Service, or

          upon booking and confirmation. No adjustments, rescheduling,
          cancellations, or modifications will be permitted under any
          circumstances, except in cases of extreme emergencies (e.g., medical
          issues with verifiable proof as described in Section 5). Missed
          sessions due to non-attendance, tardiness, or any other reason will
          not be rescheduled or refunded. Sessions must be attended in full;
          partial attendance does not entitle you to extensions or credits.
        </p>

          All sessions are conducted with the expectation of mutual
          confidentiality. However, The Mind Point reserves the right to
          disclose information if required by law or in cases of imminent harm.
          We are not liable for any outcomes, advice, or results from sessions,
          which are provided for enhancement purposes only.

            Adhering to session etiquette, such as being punctual, prepared, and
