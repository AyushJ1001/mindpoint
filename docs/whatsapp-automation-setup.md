# WhatsApp Automation Setup Guide

## Overview

The Mind Point app now includes automated WhatsApp messaging that sends enrollment confirmations alongside emails. This feature automatically notifies users via WhatsApp when they enroll in courses, therapy sessions, or supervised sessions.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Triggering**: When a user completes enrollment, the system automatically sends both an email and a WhatsApp message (if phone number is provided)
2. **Message Content**: WhatsApp messages contain the same information as emails - enrollment details, course/session information, and next steps
3. **Professional Formatting**: Messages use WhatsApp's markdown formatting for better readability

## Current Implementation

### Message Types

1. **Course Enrollment Messages**
   - Sent when users enroll in certificate courses, diplomas, internships, etc.
   - Includes course name, dates, times, and enrollment number

2. **Therapy Session Messages**
   - Sent when users book therapy/counselling sessions
   - Includes therapy type, session count, and enrollment number

3. **Supervised Session Messages**
   - Sent when users enroll in supervised therapy sessions
   - Includes supervision package, session count, and enrollment number

### Message Format

All WhatsApp messages follow this structure:

```
üéì *Enrollment Confirmation - The Mind Point*

Dear [Learner/Client/Trainee],

[Enrollment confirmation details]

*[Service] Details:*
‚Ä¢ [Key information points]

*Important Notes:*

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variable to your `.env` file:

```bash
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your_whatsapp_api_key_here
```

### 2. WhatsApp API Provider

You need to choose and integrate with a WhatsApp Business API provider. Popular options include:

#### Option A: Twilio WhatsApp API

```bash
npm install twilio
```

#### Option B: MessageBird WhatsApp API

```bash
npm install messagebird
```

#### Option C: WhatsApp Business API (Meta)

- Requires business verification with Meta
- More complex setup but official solution

### 3. Update WhatsApp Service

Replace the placeholder implementation in `lib/whatsapp.ts` with your chosen provider:

#### Example with Twilio:

```typescript
import twilio from 'twilio';

const client = twilio(process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN);

async sendMessage(message: WhatsAppMessage): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const formattedPhone = message.phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
    const phoneWithCountryCode = formattedPhone.startsWith('91')
      ? formattedPhone
      : `91${formattedPhone}`;

    await client.messages.create({
      body: message.message,
      from: `whatsapp:${process.env.TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER}`,
      to: `whatsapp:+${phoneWithCountryCode}`
    });

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('WhatsApp message sending failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

#### Example with MessageBird:

```typescript
import messagebird from 'messagebird';

const client = messagebird(process.env.MESSAGEBIRD_API_KEY);

async sendMessage(message: WhatsAppMessage): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const formattedPhone = message.phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
    const phoneWithCountryCode = formattedPhone.startsWith('91')
      ? formattedPhone
      : `91${formattedPhone}`;

    await client.conversations.send({
      to: `+${phoneWithCountryCode}`,
      type: 'text',
      content: {
        text: message.message
      },
      channelId: process.env.MESSAGEBIRD_WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_ID
    });

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('WhatsApp message sending failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 4. Phone Number Collection

To enable WhatsApp messaging, you need to collect user phone numbers during enrollment. Update your enrollment forms to include phone number fields.

### 5. Testing

1. **Test with a single enrollment**: Enroll in a course with a valid phone number
2. **Check logs**: Verify that WhatsApp messages are being generated and sent
3. **Monitor delivery**: Ensure messages are being delivered to the correct numbers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Messages not sending**: Check API credentials and phone number format
2. **Wrong phone numbers**: Ensure proper country code formatting (+91 for India)
3. **Message delivery failures**: Verify WhatsApp Business API setup
4. **Rate limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for API calls

### Debugging

1. Check server logs for WhatsApp API errors
2. Verify phone number format in the database
3. Test API credentials separately
4. Monitor message delivery status

## Security Considerations

1. **Phone Number Privacy**: Ensure phone numbers are stored securely
2. **API Key Security**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
3. **Message Content**: Avoid sending sensitive information via WhatsApp
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Future Enhancements

1. **Message Templates**: Add more customizable message templates
2. **Scheduled Messages**: Implement scheduled reminders for sessions
3. **Bulk Messaging**: Add support for bulk messaging to multiple users
